## Introduction

The Real-Time Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to develop a machine learning-based system for the real-time detection of credit card fraud. This system leverages machine learning techniques to accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives. Fraud detection is a critical component of financial security, and this project seeks to provide a robust solution to protect financial institutions and their customers.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering to prepare transaction data.
- Machine learning model selection and training for fraud detection.
- Evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance.
- A basic outline for real-time implementation (not covered in detail).
- A simplified example using scikit-learn and Python (for educational purposes).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
